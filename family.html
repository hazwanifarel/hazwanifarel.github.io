<p>
This is my small family. 
<br>
I cannot imagine living my life without my family by my side.
<br>
Family is very important and valuable to me. They are something
<br>
that should never be taken for granted. Without my family,
<br>
a large part of my life and culture would be missing. 
<br>
They are wonderful people and the greatest gift God has given to me.
<br>
My father is a responsible person. Then, my mother is kind-hearted.
<br>
She is the one who is very concerned about the needs of our family. 
<br>
They always want the best for their children.
