Hi!
My name is Fatin Hazwani binti Shah Amiruddin Lutfee. I'm twenty one years old. 
I'm a sudent in Faculty Information Management at UITM Sungai Petani, Kedah.
Now, it's have been for a year I study and currently in semester 5.  
I have throughly enjoyed myself when I'm study at university. 
The university is great and the atmosphere is one that makes me 
actually want to go to class, because this semester my friend and I were able to study face to face.
</p>

<p>
I have start online learning from semester 1. 
So now, I only have 1 semester left before I finish my diploma.
Learning remotely without being in regular face-to-face contact with 
instructor in the classroom is very burdensome because I live in the 
interior and it is difficult to get an internet connection.
It was a bad experiences in my life, but this is exactly made me not to give up.
</p>

<p>
Now, I would like to tell a little bit about myself. I am a happy person but sometimes I am very easily offended by the surrounding situation. 
One simple example is when my family or my friends ignore me and talk rudely to me.
However, I will not sulk for too long and I am also a person who easily forgives others.
It is because Mel Robbins once said "Forgive others, not because they deserve forgiveness, 
but because you deserve peace."
